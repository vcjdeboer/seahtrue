Seahtrue version focuses getting specific data needed analysis. data extracted, prepared calculations preprocessing. make sure everything accurate, initial data preprocessed data go thorough checks.","code":""},{"path":[]},{"path":"https://vcjdeboer.github.io/seahtrue/reference/seahtrue-package.html","id":"author","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Author","title":"seahtrue: Seahtrue revives XF data for structured data analysis — seahtrue-package","text":"Maintainer: Vincent de Boer vincent.deboer@wur.nl Authors: Gerwin Smits contributors: Xiang Zhang [contributor]","code":""},{"path":"https://vcjdeboer.github.io/seahtrue/reference/seahtrue_output_donor_A.html","id":null,"dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Dataset donor A — seahtrue_output_donor_A","title":"Dataset donor A — seahtrue_output_donor_A","text":"dataset containing output donor . data contains preprocess  output generated run Seahtrue pipeline. data  created generated input file '20191219_SciRep_PBMCs_donor_A.xlsx',  located inst/extdata directory.","code":""},{"path":"https://vcjdeboer.github.io/seahtrue/reference/seahtrue_output_donor_A.html","id":"ref-usage","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Usage","title":"Dataset donor A — seahtrue_output_donor_A","text":"","code":"seahtrue_output_donor_A"},{"path":"https://vcjdeboer.github.io/seahtrue/reference/seahtrue_output_donor_A.html","id":"format","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Format","title":"Dataset donor A — seahtrue_output_donor_A","text":"data frame 1 rows 7 variables. plate_id Barcode 'Assay Configuration' sheet Seahorse Excel file. filepath_seahorse Path Seahorse Excel file. date Date derived 'Assay Configuration' sheet Seahorse Excel file. assay_info Date derived 'Assay Configuration' sheet Seahorse Excel file. injection_info Dataframe information 'Assay Configuration' sheet Seahorse Excel file. raw_data Preprocessed raw dataframe Seahorse 'Raw' sheet. rate_data Preprocessed rate data 'Rate' sheet.","code":""},{"path":"https://vcjdeboer.github.io/seahtrue/reference/seahtrue_output_donor_B.html","id":null,"dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Dataset donor B — seahtrue_output_donor_B","title":"Dataset donor B — seahtrue_output_donor_B","text":"dataset containing output donor . data contains preprocess  output generated run Seahtrue pipeline. data  created generated input file '20200110_SciRep_PBMCs_donor_B.xlsx',  located inst/extdata directory.","code":""},{"path":"https://vcjdeboer.github.io/seahtrue/reference/seahtrue_output_donor_B.html","id":"ref-usage","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Usage","title":"Dataset donor B — seahtrue_output_donor_B","text":"","code":"seahtrue_output_donor_B"},{"path":"https://vcjdeboer.github.io/seahtrue/reference/seahtrue_output_donor_B.html","id":"format","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Format","title":"Dataset donor B — seahtrue_output_donor_B","text":"data frame 1 rows 7 variables: plate_id Barcode 'Assay Configuration' sheet Seahorse Excel file. filepath_seahorse Path Seahorse Excel file. date Date derived 'Assay Configuration' sheet Seahorse Excel file. assay_info Date derived 'Assay Configuration' sheet Seahorse Excel file. injection_info Dataframe information 'Assay Configuration' sheet Seahorse Excel file. raw_data Preprocessed raw dataframe Seahorse 'Raw' sheet. rate_data Preprocessed rate data 'Rate' sheet.","code":""},{"path":"https://vcjdeboer.github.io/seahtrue/reference/seahtrue_output_donor_C.html","id":null,"dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Dataset donor C — seahtrue_output_donor_C","title":"Dataset donor C — seahtrue_output_donor_C","text":"dataset containing output donor . data contains preprocess  output generated run Seahtrue pipeline. data  created generated input file '20200110_SciRep_PBMCs_donor_C.xlsx',  located inst/extdata directory.","code":""},{"path":"https://vcjdeboer.github.io/seahtrue/reference/seahtrue_output_donor_C.html","id":"ref-usage","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Usage","title":"Dataset donor C — seahtrue_output_donor_C","text":"","code":"seahtrue_output_donor_C"},{"path":"https://vcjdeboer.github.io/seahtrue/reference/seahtrue_output_donor_C.html","id":"format","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Format","title":"Dataset donor C — seahtrue_output_donor_C","text":"data frame 1 rows 7 variables: plate_id Barcode 'Assay Configuration' sheet Seahorse Excel file. filepath_seahorse Path Seahorse Excel file. date Date derived 'Assay Configuration' sheet Seahorse Excel file. assay_info Date derived 'Assay Configuration' sheet Seahorse Excel file. injection_info Dataframe information 'Assay Configuration' sheet Seahorse Excel file. raw_data Preprocessed raw dataframe Seahorse 'Raw' sheet. rate_data Preprocessed rate data 'Rate' sheet.","code":""}]
